<p>Hi! My name is Aanshi Goel. I'm a second year student currently pursuing BTech in Computer Science from IGDTUW.
    I am aiming to explore the plethora of fields in the world of computers and AI. Adept in various programming languages including Python and C++, I'm driven and self-motivated 
    and therefore effective in completing tasks with minimal supervision. I'm fascinated with data and hence I want to dive deep into Data science and Machine learning. 
    To explore other fields, this is my first attempt at Web development.
</p>
